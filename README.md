## Steps to import and use react-bootstrap in react app

- Create a react app or simply do npm create-react-app, if you want to work on the existing application, please ignore the current and next step.
- $ npm install react react-dom
- $ npm install react-bootstrap
- Including prosoft style sheet in index.html, this will override bootstrap's css classes.

  '<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://d260ckbc6brolt.cloudfront.net/prosoft-ui/branches/origin/rebranding/css/prosoft-ui.min.css">'

- Just go to App.jsx and look for imports and implementation in render() method.
Ignore rest of the files, those files are for my own practice.
