## Steps to import and use react-bootstrap in react app

- Create a react app or simply do npm create-react-app, if you want to work on the existing application, please ignore the current and next step.
- $ npm install react react-dom
- $ npm install react-bootstrap
- Including prosoft style sheet in index.html, this will override bootstrap's css classes.

- Just go to App.jsx and look for imports and implementation in render() method.
Ignore rest of the files, those files are for my own practice.
